# dockerfile_migrate.sh - declarative Dockerfile-migration list (#567).
#
# A deep module behind a small interface: `apply_migrations <dockerfile>`
# iterates an ordered, data-driven list of {detect, transform} migrations
# and applies each migration whose `detect` matches. It replaces the
# accreting pile of one-off seds that upgrade.sh Step 5 used to carry to
# heal downstream Dockerfiles after a base contract change.
#
# Each migration `X` is two functions:
#   _migrate_X_detect <file>   exit 0 -> migration applies to this file
#   _migrate_X_apply  <file>   perform the (idempotent) rewrite
# and one entry in the ordered `_MIGRATIONS` array. apply_migrations runs
# them in array order; this lets later migrations build on the shape an
# earlier one normalised (e.g. the lib-COPY split before the wrapper-COPY
# rename).
#
# Apply policy (inherited from upgrade.sh's Step-5 convention):
#   - `detect` matches a known shape -> `apply` runs and is IDEMPOTENT
#     (a second run is a no-op).
#   - structure does not match / anchor missing / ambiguous -> `detect`
#     returns non-zero so the migration is SKIPPED; where a partial /
#     custom shape is recognised the `apply` _log_warn's and leaves the
#     file untouched rather than force-rewriting.
#
# Compatible with ADR-00000006: the `.base` path contract is frozen; this
# restructures the heal MECHANISM, not the frozen paths.
#
# Style: Google Shell Style Guide.

# Guard against double-sourcing.

# v0.41.0 moved the user-facing wrappers (build/run/exec/stop/prune.sh) out
# of the flat .base/script/docker/ root into .base/script/docker/wrapper/.
# Two pre-v0.41.0 lint-stage COPY shapes then resolve to zero files:
#   A  COPY *.sh /lint/                       (root-anchored, the #399 shape)
#   B  COPY .base/script/docker/*.sh /lint/   (flat top-level glob)
# Both heal to the current wrapper-glob shape:
#   COPY .base/script/docker/wrapper/*.sh /lint/
# Idempotent: a Dockerfile already on the wrapper/ shape is not detected.
