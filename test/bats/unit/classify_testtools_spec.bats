# classify_testtools_spec.bats -- does the classifier know when the
# tooling image is stale?
#
# why: `testtools_changed` tells every image-consuming job whether to
# rebuild the tooling image from source instead of pulling the rolling
# `:main`. On a pull request it is computed from the diff; on every other
# event it was the literal `false`, including the one event that can
# answer it -- a push to main whose commit is what makes `:main` stale in
# the first place. So the merge that added a tool to the Dockerfile ran
# the whole post-merge suite inside the image from before it. The probe
# was supposed to compensate and was itself too narrow to notice; both
# halves are the same incident, and this is the half that can be
# answered from the diff.
#
# The cases drive the REAL classify step against a synthetic push, so
# each reads the output the step writes.

# why: The reported case. A push to main that changes the test-tools
# Dockerfile is exactly the push for which the rolling tag is stale --
# the republish that would refresh it is racing this very run -- and it
# was the push that reported the image unchanged.
@test "classify: a push that changes the test-tools Dockerfile rebuilds it (#1010)" {
  run _classify_push dockerfile/Dockerfile.test-tools

}

# why: The guard against answering true to every push, which would put a
# full multi-arch tooling build in front of every merge. A push that
# leaves the Dockerfile alone takes the pull path, where the probe is now
# the thing that catches a stale image.
@test "classify: a push that leaves it alone still pulls (#1010)" {

# why: A non-PR event still runs the full suite. The flag being
